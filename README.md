# Medals Predictor Model

## Overview
The Medals Predictor Model is a machine learning model designed to predict the number of medals a country might win in a sports competition based on various factors such as the number of athletes, their age, and previous medal counts. This project aims to provide insights into medal predictions for different countries participating in sports events.

## Features
- Predicts the number of medals a country might win in a sports competition.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and make predictions.
- Allows users to input various parameters such as the number of athletes, their age, and previous medal counts.

## Usage
To use the Medals Predictor Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/adityajha2005/MedalsPredictorModel.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the main script to train the model and make predictions:
python main.py


4. Input the required parameters when prompted and view the predicted medal count for the specified country.

## Data
The project utilizes historical data from past sports events to train the machine learning model. The data includes information about countries, the number of athletes, their age, and previous medal counts.
